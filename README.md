THE website

How do I work this thing? O.o
Today we made crepes and they were very good. We made Santa Clauses with our last crepe, but Anissa folded hers before we took the picture. Then I took a shower. When I got out Anissa was making tea and we decided to make a website, and that is the story of this repository. The story will continue though. Right now I'm trying to link the changes I did on GitHub Desktop to this website? Yaaas.
